# Shenbury MetaDAO Listing

## Project Overview

Shenbury introduces a decentralized, self-contained intelligent infrastructure for authenticating and tokenizing fine art and historical artifacts. At its core is the **AI Agent Swarm**, combining local vector reasoning, closed-loop learning, and on-chain provenance. Each agent operates independently with a fully local stack—database, embeddings, and learning layer—without reliance on external APIs or cloud systems.

## Key Features

### AI Agent Swarm
- **Local Execution**: All AI processing runs locally without cloud dependencies
- **Self-Contained Agents**: Independent operation with embedded knowledge bases
- **Specialized Roles**: Dedicated agents for imaging, spectroscopy, and documentation analysis
- **Closed-Loop Learning**: Continuous improvement through reinforcement feedback

### Technical Architecture
- **AgentDB**: High-performance local vector database with HNSW indexing and 4-32x compression
- **ReasoningBank**: Closed-loop learning system inspired by DeepMind's framework
- **Local Embeddings**: transformers.js with Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model (384-dimensional vectors)
- **No External Dependencies**: Fully autonomous operation without cloud services

## Tokenomics

### Token Information
- **Name**: Shenbury Provenance Token
- **Symbol**: SHBY
- **Standard**: To be determined by MetaDAO
- **Total Supply**: 25,800,000 SHBY
- **Conversion Rate**: 10,000 SHBY = 1 NFT
- **Minting**: Tokens minted and managed by MetaDAO

### Token Distribution
- **No Presale**: Tokens will be minted by MetaDAO with no presale
- **Liquidity**: Provided through MetaDAO's launch mechanism
- **Ecosystem**: Reserved for platform development and community growth

## Business Model

Shenbury's business model focuses on becoming a go-to-market service for verified high-value art assets. By providing trusted authentication and provenance verification, Shenbury enables collectors to confidently bring verified pieces to auction.

### Revenue Model
Shenbury charges a 10% commission on the winning bid for any verified artifact sold at auction. This simple, performance-based model aligns our incentives with successful sales outcomes.

### Market Opportunity
The global art market exceeds $60B with less than 5% digitization and verification services penetration. Shenbury targets the high-end market, focusing on artifacts valued over $1M.

### Competitive Advantages
- **Technology Leadership**: Local AI agent swarms provide unparalleled performance and privacy
- **Cost Efficiency**: Autonomous operation reduces verification costs by over 90%
- **Scalability**: No cloud dependencies enable infinite scaling
- **Trust**: On-chain provenance provides immutable verification records

### Revenue Projections
- **Year 1**: $50M
- **Year 2**: $150M
- **Year 3**: $300M

Based on partnerships with major auction houses and a target of $500M in relic sales over three years, these projections reflect a more achievable growth trajectory focused on quality verification services and premium relic sales.

## DAO Governance

Shenbury operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governed by smart contracts and community consensus. The DAO does not own any physical assets, including works of art. All art collections and physical assets remain the property of their respective owners.

### DAO Governance Agreement
Purchasers agree to the Shenbury DAO LLC's operating agreement governing the project. The complete operating agreement is available in the [SHENBURY-DAO-OPERATING-AGREEMENT.md](SHENBURY-DAO-OPERATING-AGREEMENT.md) file.
