# Shenbury MetaDAO Listing

## Project Overview

Shenbury Ltd. is a Hong Kong-based asset-backed company. We are tokenizing our proprietary, legally-owned **$257M+ collection of museum-grade Chinese imperial ceramics**.

Our core innovation is twofold:
1.  **The Assets:** We hold legal title to a world-class collection, eliminating counterparty risk.
2.  **The Technology:** We built the "Dynasty X" AI-Powered Provenance Protocol, an autonomous AI swarm that verifies our assets, solving the "oracle problem" for RWA tokenization.

## Key Features

### AI Agent Swarm (The "Dynasty X" Protocol)
- **Local Execution**: All AI processing runs locally without cloud dependencies.
- **Self-Contained Agents**: Independent operation with embedded knowledge bases.
- **Closed-Loop Learning**: Continuous improvement through reinforcement feedback, validated by our expert art historians.

### Technical Architecture
- **AgentDB**: High-performance local vector database (HNSW).
- **ReasoningBank**: Closed-loop learning system.
- **Local Embeddings**: transformers.js (Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model).
- **No External Dependencies**: Fully autonomous operation.

## Tokenomics

- **Symbol**: SHBY
- **Standard**: ERC-20 (Ethereum Blockchain)
- **Total Supply**: **25,800,000 SHBY**
- **Conversion Rate**: 10,000 SHBY = 1 NFT (TBD)
- **Minting**: Tokens minted and managed by Shenbury Ltd.

## Business Model & Asset Valuation

Our business model is built on the tokenization and sale of our **owned** $257M+ asset portfolio. The SHBY token represents a stake in the ecosystem built around these assets.

### Asset Portfolio (Initial Collection)
The launch is backed by six (6) museum-grade artifacts, including an exceptionally rare Ru Kiln Washer and a Yuhuchun Vase, with a combined minimum valuation of **$257,000,000 USD**. All artifacts are legally owned by Shenbury Ltd. and held in secure, audited custody in Hong Kong.

### Asset Liquidation Schedule (Projections)
Our revenue projections are based on the strategic sale (tokenization and/or auction) of our existing collection.
- **Year 1:** $50M (Liquidation of initial assets)
- **Year 2:** $150M (Liquidation of subsequent assets)
- **Year 3:** $300M (Expansion into a service model, verifying third-party assets)

*These projections reflect a multi-year plan, starting with our owned assets and scaling into a platform.*
