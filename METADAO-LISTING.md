## Project Name and Description

**Project Name:** Shenbury Ltd.
**Token Name:** Shenbury Provenance Token (SHBY)

**Short Description:** 
Shenbury is building the "Dynasty X" AI-Powered Provenance Protocol, an autonomous AI swarm that verifies high-value assets, solving the "oracle problem" for RWA tokenization.

**Long Description:**
Shenbury Ltd. is a Hong Kong-based technology company developing the "Dynasty X" AI-Powered Provenance Protocol. Our autonomous AI swarm verifies high-value assets, solving the "oracle problem" for RWA tokenization. We're unlocking the $60B+ illiquid art market by working with a private collector client pipeline of $600-700M+ portfolio of museum-grade Chinese imperial ceramics with cutting-edge AI verification technology. The SHBY token represents a stake in the ecosystem built around our innovative technology platform.

## Token Information

- **Token Name**: Shenbury Provenance Token
- **Token Ticker**: SHBY

## Financial Information

- **Minimum Raise Amount**: $750,000
- **Monthly Team Budget**: $125,000

*Based on a $750,000 raise, we're allocating $125,000 monthly for developer costs, which represents 1/6th of the minimum raise (the maximum allowed by MetaDAO). This budget ensures adequate development resources for our technology platform while maintaining operational efficiency.*

## Performance Package Configuration

We choose to pre-allocate 12.9M tokens to a performance package, split into 5 equal tranches:
- 2.58M tokens unlock at 2x ICO price
- 2.58M tokens unlock at 4x ICO price
- 2.58M tokens unlock at 8x ICO price
- 2.58M tokens unlock at 16x ICO price
- 2.58M tokens unlock at 32x ICO price

Minimum unlock time: 18 months from ICO date.

## Intellectual Property

The founder(s) will transfer the following intellectual properties to the project's entity:
- Domain names: shenbury.com, shenbury.ai, shenbury.org
- Software: Dynasty X AI Protocol, AgentDB, ReasoningBank
- Social media accounts: @shenbury on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn
- All future developments and improvements to the core technology

## Key Features

### AI Agent Swarm (The "Dynasty X" Protocol)
- **Local Execution**: All AI processing runs locally without cloud dependencies.
- **Self-Contained Agents**: Independent operation with embedded knowledge bases.
- **Closed-Loop Learning**: Continuous improvement through reinforcement feedback.

### Technical Architecture
- **AgentDB**: High-performance local vector database (HNSW).
- **ReasoningBank**: Closed-loop learning system.
- **Local Embeddings**: transformers.js (Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model).
- **No External Dependencies**: Fully autonomous operation.

## Tokenomics

### Token Information
- **Name**: Shenbury Provenance Token
- **Symbol**: SHBY
- **Standard**: ERC-20 (Ethereum Blockchain)
- **Total Supply**: **25,800,000 SHBY**
- **Conversion Rate**: 10,000 SHBY = 1 NFT (TBD)
- **Minting**: Tokens minted and managed by Shenbury Ltd.

### Token Distribution
- **No Presale**: Tokens will be part of a structured public launch.
- **Liquidity**: 2,900,000 SHBY
- **Ecosystem & Treasury**: 12,900,000 SHBY (Vested)
- **Public Launch**: 10,000,000 SHBY

## Business Model & Technology Licensing

Our business model is built on licensing our proprietary "Dynasty X" AI-Powered Provenance Protocol technology. The SHBY token represents a stake in the ecosystem built around this innovative technology platform.

### Technology Platform
The launch is backed by our proprietary AI technology stack, including the "Dynasty X" AI Agent Swarm, AgentDB vector database, and ReasoningBank closed-loop learning system. This technology represents years of research and development in autonomous AI systems for asset verification.

### Revenue Projections (Projections)
Our revenue projections are based on a simplified fee structure for bringing high-value pieces to auction:
- **Year 1:** $15M (50+ artifacts processed for auction)
- **Year 2:** $45M (200+ artifacts processed for auction)
- **Year 3:** $90M (500+ artifacts processed for auction)

*These projections reflect our streamlined approach with a single revenue stream: charging fees for processing multi-million dollar pieces for auction. With no gated services or data monetization, we maintain a lean operation with human-in-the-loop verification for quality assurance. Based on our $600-700M client pipeline representing 500+ high-value artifacts.*
