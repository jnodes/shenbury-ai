# MetaDAO Listing Information - Shenbury

## Project Name and Description

**Project Name**: Shenbury - AI-Verified Chinese Imperial Ceramics on Blockchain

**Short Description**: An AI-driven provenance network that authenticates and tokenizes museum-grade Chinese imperial ceramics, unlocking a historically illiquid $60B+ art market for on-chain investors.

**Long Description**: Shenbury is an AI-driven provenance network that authenticates and tokenizes museum-grade Chinese imperial ceramics — unlocking a historically illiquid $60B+ art market for on-chain investors. By combining multi-agent AI verification with tokenized Real World Assets (RWAs), Shenbury enables global collectors to hold verifiable stakes in physical masterpieces backed by centuries of cultural heritage.

The global art market is a multi-billion dollar industry but remains one of the least liquid and most opaque asset classes. Provenance — the ability to verify authenticity and ownership history — has long been the industry's Achilles' heel. Even elite collectors and auction houses rely on subjective human expertise, leading to fraud risk, value distortion, and limited accessibility.

Meanwhile, the Real World Asset (RWA) sector is scaling toward a projected multi-trillion-dollar market, yet fine art remains excluded due to authentication bottlenecks and the absence of a trustless provenance infrastructure.

Shenbury introduces a proprietary AI Agent Swarm, a decentralized authentication system that validates artworks with microscopic and historical precision. Each AI agent acts as a virtual expert specializing in a specific domain:
- Visual Pattern Recognition Agent — analyzes crackle patterns, glaze color spectra, and tool marks unique to each dynasty.
- Historical Database Agent — cross-references global museum collections, auction records, and excavation reports to identify known forgery techniques.
- Chemical Composition Agent — verifies glaze and clay composition consistent with authentic kiln sites and dynastic material science.
- Provenance Chain Agent — confirms ownership history through blockchain-based records and historical documentation.

Findings from each agent are synthesized into a single authentication consensus, permanently recorded on-chain. This process ensures immutable provenance and enables verified tokenization of physical assets.
