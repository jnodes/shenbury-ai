        description: 'This extraordinarily rare washer represents the pinnacle of Song ceramic achievement. The vessel is shaped like a six-part flower mouth with three tiny sesame nail marks on the bottom. The distinctive sky-blue glaze with its subtle crackle pattern was considered the finest of all Chinese ceramics. The azure glaze is particularly notable for its purity and the intricate network of ice cracks, which are a hallmark of Ru ware.',

        technicalNotes: 'The glaze exhibits the characteristic "sky-blue" color achieved through reduction firing. The crackled glaze effect, known as "crazing," was highly prized and added to the visual and tactile appeal of the piece. X-ray fluorescence analysis could confirm the presence of agate powder in the glaze composition, a hallmark of authentic Ru ware.',
        culturalSignificance: 'Ru kilns operated for only about 20 years (1086-1106) exclusively for the Northern Song court. Fewer than 100 genuine pieces are known to exist worldwide, with the Taipei National Palace Museum holding 21 pieces and the Beijing Palace Museum having 17 pieces. A common saying goes: "Even with a fortune, a single piece of Ru porcelain is priceless" (纵有家财万贯，不抵汝瓷一件).',
